 How to setup amms from git repository:

 Navigate to the target installation directory (can be arbitrary), for example:

 cd /home/user
 git clone git://github.com/wellcomer/amms.git

 create a symlink:

 ln -s /home/user/amms /usr/lib/amms

 Copy the configuration file conf to /etc/amms/amms.conf
 and edit it to fit your needs.

 Integration with SQUID:
